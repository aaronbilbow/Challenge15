The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. 
They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. 
I have developed a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other 
government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.
